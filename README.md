Adding new data:
1.Clone the repository
2.Cops the folder with measurements to the repository
3.Commit and push changes

Note: if you want to process your data, use a 'For graps.ipynb' file. Just fill in your time and folder name, the program will do the rest. Than create whatever pots you need. 
Soon I will add docstrings.
